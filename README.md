zellwk tutorial creating this app(https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/)

Created using the tutorial above, switched from Star Wars themed to Jurassic themed.

I have an example .env file to show how I set that up
also need to run during setup to use an env file: npm i dotenv 

also thanks to dcode on Youtube for how to get env going in Node.js

I also referenced https://github.com/zellwk/crud-demo for where to place code when I got lost in the tutorial(it was mostly straight forward)
